# Jupyter Docker Notebook Adapted for Centos
This project is an adaptation of the Tensorflow/Data Science Notebooks in 
https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks for Centos.  The Dockerfile is an
almalgamation and adaptation of several Dockerfiles in the project listed
above. The docker-compose is designed for building the jupyter docker image.
Almost all the other code is cut-and-paste directly from
https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks

As such, licensing for each file (besides the docker-compose) can be found in
https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks

Have a Centos Jupyter Notebook Day :)
